app.py: The main file that starts the Flask application. It sets up the app, configures settings, connects to the database, and registers routes for different parts of the application.

config/: This folder contains configuration files. It includes settings for the database and initializes the database connection.

models/: Stores all the database models. Each model represents a table in the database, like Farmer, User, and Animal, and defines the relationships and data structure.

routes/: Holds files with route definitions for different parts of the app (like user routes and farmer routes). These routes control how the application responds to different URL requests.

.gitignore: Lists files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. This helps keep the repository clean and protects sensitive information like environment variables.

requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, like Flask and SQLAlchemy. You can install all dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.

README.md: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to use it. It’s a helpful guide for anyone new to the project.

file_structure.txt: Documents the file structure of the project, explaining the purpose of each folder and file. It’s a quick reference for understanding the project layout.

venv: A file for storing environment variables like database credentials and secret keys. These settings should not be shared publicly, so this file is ignored by Git.
